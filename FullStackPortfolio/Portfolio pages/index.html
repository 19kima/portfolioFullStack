                    <p>Portfolio items include solutions in C#, HTML, CSS, and Javascript all written in Visual Studios. Proper source control using Github and GitKraken was used to complete group projects. Other topics covered include Object Oriented Programming, FileIOC, MVC, and Full Stack Development.</p>
                    <p>The Full Stack Summer Camp taught a lot of difficult material in a very short amount of time. This required a team effort that really helped to make sure everyone was caught up all the time. For projects, deadlines were set aggressively and really encouraged teamwork to complete them. Overall, the camp taught many additional and valuable practices such as time management, splitting up work, team program development/source control, and problem solving that really helped simulate the real workforce. </p>

                    <h4>ATM</h4>
                    <p>
                        This project introduced C# and simulated an ATM using Object Oriented Programming. Most of the code was using a switch statement, if statements, and simple mathmatic functions. Most of the time for this project was used bulletproofing the program from bad user inputs as well as reading strings.

                    <h4>File IO</h4>
                    <p>
                        The goal for this project was to read a data document and then return another data document with a certain set of data. After the initial code to access and write data, it was simply a matter of changing the code to do specific tasks when returning the new data set. After this was done, source control was used to combine all the projects together. Initially, the combined program simply output everything from each program, but our group decided to split each function into a method in a class and call it in the main method using a switch statement.

                    <h4>Client Conversion</h4>
                    <p>
                        For my part of the project, I converted centimeters to meters using javascript. Additional conversion sites were added and were accessed using a navigation bar. The user had to put in an input and then after clicking a submit button, the output was displayed. This code was pretty simple and similar for each page. Next we added styling using css. We created a style tile with color and fonts. Using online resources we had to learn how to style colors, fonts, center items, and size items. The css was the most time consuming part of the project. Overall, a pretty simple concept, applied with very time consuming styling.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <h4>Server Conversion</h4>
                    <p>
                        This project also converted units, however, instead of javascript, C# was used in a Model View Controller (MVC) model. The input was passed to a controller level which converted units in c# and then transferred the output to the model which was displayed on the view. Initially, the concept was less straightforward, but the code was far simpler than the javascript version. Afterwards, the view was changed to apply the stylesheet we had already created, so our page looked very similar to our previous page except we couldn’t get bootstrap to apply properly, so spacing was not as clean.
